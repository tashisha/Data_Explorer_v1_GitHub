# The-Data-Explorer
The Data Explorer is a data visualization system meant to help researchers visualize data for non-researchers.
Specifically it is meant to allow the general public to explore scientific data sets and create their own "data stories" about those data sets.
This current version is Data Explorer v1 and it is a prototype. For a walkthrough of how to use the Data Explorer from the user's end check out this video tutorial:
